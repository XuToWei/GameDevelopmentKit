9 October 2021
Requires Unity 2019.4.4f1+

    Features:
        - Updated Chat Demo #16 to calculate the text space used inside the scroller, instead of relying ont the Unity Content Size Fitter. This has less accuracy, but is far more efficient for text cells.


Version 2.30.2
23 September 2021
Requires Unity 2019.4.4f1+

    Fixes:
        - Updated CellView.cs in Demo #5 to handle UnityWebRequest results for Unity version 2020+ without getting a deprecated code warning.

7 September 2021
Requires Unity 2019.4.4f1+

    Fixes:
        - Added optional forceCalculateRange parameter (with default to false) to JumpToDataIndex to force a calculation of the active cell range immediately after the jump (instead of one frame after).



Version 2.30.0
19 August 2021
Requires Unity 2019.4.4f1+

    Features:
        - Changed the parenting of recycled cell views to deactivate the game objects for efficiency

    Fixes:
        - Modified the clamping when setting the scroll position internally so that it does not exceed the ScrollSize


Version 2.29.0
18 March 2021
Requires Unity 2019.4.4f1+

    Fixes:
        - Fixed Tween.cs to calculate the last position after assigning the new position so that the first instance of last position is correct
        - Re-worked Demo #15 to accommodate looping
        - Fixed Demo #13 Controller.cs LoadData method to jump back to the previous ScrollPosition after reload. This gives a smoother transition than the jump did

    Features:
        - Added SetScrollPositionImmediately to EnhancedScroller.cs to refresh the active cells immediately after setting the scroll position (normally this would occur when ScrollRect triggers the change in position on the next frame). This is useful if you need to manually change a cell's height after setting the position.
        - Added IgnoreLoopJump to EnhancedScroller.cs to allow you to shut off the loop jumping that gives the illusion of a continous stream of cells. This is usefull if you are manually changing the cell's size around the jump trigger boundaries.
        - Modified Data.cs in Demo #15 to have some properties that calculate the cell's size based on its expansion state
        - Added preloadData flag to Demo #5 to show how to buffer cells before they are visible to cut down on the download visibility of remote resources


Version 2.28.2
13 March 2021
Requires Unity 2019.4.4f1+

    Fixes:
        - Updated Demo #16 Chat.cs to continually update the size of the spacer so that there is no dead space at the top of the scroller.


Version 2.28.1
11 March 2021
Requires Unity 2019.4.4f1+

    Fixes:
        - Updated Demo #16 Chat.cs to zero out the spacer after the initial cells scroll off screen. This allows you to scroll back to the top without going off screen.
        - Fixed MyTextCellView prefab in Demo #16 to center the text better.

        - Added access to the Container (RectTransform) that contains the ScrollRect's content

    Fixes:
        - Removed loop reset code in ScrollPosition property to avoid incorrect jumps while tweening.
        - Fixed Demo #11 Controller to use the scroller's content anchored position instead of scroll position (which is always zero) for threshold calculations.


Version 2.25.0
03 June 2020
Requires Unity 2017+

    Features:
        - Added tweening cell view heights to Demo 15
        - Added accessors to FirstPadder and LastPadder objects of the scroller in EnhancedScroller.cs
        - Added lookAheadBefore and lookAheadAfter values to EnhancedScroller.cs to allow pulling in more cell views than are visible, either before the visible cells or after them, respectively. Good for loading cell view resources before they become visible or for tweening.
        - Modified _CalculateCurrentActiveCellRange to use the lookAheadBefore and lookAheadAfter values to calculate active cell range

    Fixed spelling of method JumpToDataIndex in the EnhancedScroller.cs script.

Version 2.0
July 30, 2015

Big changes in this release. Note: if you have already deeply integrated the 1.x scroller in your project, it might be better to hold off on upgrading until you start a new project. The new scroller is a lot less connected to the data and cell views, so there will be significant changes to your code if you are upgrading.

    The scroller no longer requires the data to be passed to it. It is completely unaware of the underlying data, instead relying on a delegate script to give it the information it needs. You no longer have to have your list as a set of objects. This allows a more flexible model and better separation of concerns for a true MVC solution. The delegate provides the cell sizes, the number of cells, and the cell view to display for a given data index.
    Setup of the scroller in the scene is much simpler now. You don't need to worry about anchors and pivots as much. You also don't need to set up much on the Scroll Rect component as that is handled automatically for you at scene start.
    The scroller can handle more than one type of cell prefab. The scroller will recycle the correct type as long as your cell identifiers are unique.
    Cell spacing and scroller padding have been added.
    More robust SmallList class that can be used in your project on things other than just the scroller. The SmallList is memory friendly, not releasing memory to the garbage collector.
    Three new demos to get your creative ideas flowing.
    Internal improvements to memory usage and speed, as well as some bug fixes from 1.x.


Version 1.2
June 03, 2015

    Added Demo 7 to show how images and selection can be incorporated


Version 1.1
